      <h4>What is NotDAO?</h4>
      <p>Hard to tell, but DAO it is not.</p>
      </br>
      <h4>Who is behind it?</h4>
      <p>Some say <a href="https://twitter.com/sasha_nft">@sasha_nft</a>, some say Sam Hyde.</p>
      </br>
      <h4>What do you do?</h4>
      <p>I phunk the JPEGs I admire (and can horizontaly flip legaly).</p>
      </br>
      <h4>Will I make money if I buy your JPEGs?</h4>
      <p>No.</p>
      </br>
      <h4>Is there any reason to buy your JPEGs?</h4>
      <p>A few of which being a degen at heart is the most important one. Being a sucker for memes also helps.</p>
      </br>
      <h4>Where is your roadmap?</h4>
      <p>I keep hearing that word but still don't know what it means.</p>
      </br>
      <h4>What is the utility of your JPEGs?</h4>
      <p>Another word I keep hearing, but I don't know what it means. I'll google it later.</p>
      </br>
      <h4>Where can I see those JPEGs you phunked?</h4>
      <p>On OpenSea: <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/not-noun">NotNouns</a>.</p>
      </br>
      <h4>What are NotNouns?</h4>
      <p>NotNouns are to Nouns what Phunks are to Punks , but with no bad blood between. If you know, you know. If you don't, then this is not a project for you.</p>
      </br>
      <h4>Are you affiliated with any of the projects you phunk?</h4>
      <p>No.</p>
      </br>
      <h4>When m00n?</h4>
      <p>Soon™, of course.</p>
      </br>
      <h4>I have more questions</h4>
      <p>Ask them on twitter.</p>
